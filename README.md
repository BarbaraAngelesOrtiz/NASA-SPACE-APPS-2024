### High-Level Summary

The “Ocean World Creator” project, developed by Team Oceánides, is an interactive website that immerses users in the factors affecting ocean worlds, such as their position in a star system, atmospheric presence, geological activity, and water levels. Inspired by the “Choose Your Own Adventure” books, users answer questions and make choices that lead to various outcomes, from thriving chemosynthetic ecosystems to barren, frozen, or hostile planets. AI-generated images and 3D comparisons with known moons or exoplanets enhance understanding and engagement. The project aims to make learning about these complex concepts both accessible and enjoyable, sparking curiosity and deep engagement.

### Project Details

The challenge of educating students, enthusiasts, and curious minds who are new to planetary science, astrobiology, and non-Earth-like ecosystems is tackled through an interactive and immersive platform designed to spark curiosity and captivate users. The platform utilizes photorealistic photos, videos, 3D models, and interactive elements. It all starts with an introduction to planetary science and basic biology, providing the essential tools to seamlessly move on to the next step: an interactive way where the objective is to create a habitable ocean world that thrives with chemosynthetic forms of life.

The project makes learning about complex scientific concepts both accessible and enjoyable. It demystifies topics such as the formation of ocean worlds, geological activity, habitability conditions, and the potential for life in environments devoid of sunlight. By simulating these unique settings, the project helps users understand how life could potentially thrive in conditions completely different from our planet, making these scientific concepts accessible to a broader audience.

The development of this interactive and immersive platform began with a comprehensive research phase, focusing on planetary science, astrobiology, and non-Earth-like ecosystems around oceanic worlds. This research is summarized at the start, providing to the users with a basic knowledge about planetary science, and links to different sources. The interaction between the factors determining the evolution of life on ocean worlds is further developed later, with the creation of 6 unique worlds.

For each one is provided a global description of the star system, planetary parameters and the potential ecosystems, focusing on how they interact with the environment . We made a great effort to think outside the box, considering many possibilities. They could be planets or exomoons. Life can thrive on the surface or at the bottom of the ocean. What would happen if exotic ices formed due to high pressure? Are other sources of energy besides geothermal possible? Up to what temperature can water remain liquid? Is the lack of atmosphere an issue?

Each world is illustrated with photorealistic photos, 3D elements, and videos, showcasing views from space, the main surface and atmospheric features, the oceans, and the unique forms of life that thrive there. Each planet is compared to Earth and associated with real exoplanets listed in the planet catalogues from NASA and ESA. Additionally, references to existing moons from the Solar System or even ancient geological eras from our planet, where life may have been similar to our fictional worlds, are included.

We expect that through iterative testing and feedback from users, educators, and enthusiasts, the project will evolve to ensure accessibility and enjoyment for a broad audience, ultimately making complex scientific concepts both understandable and captivating. In the future, other scenarios can be included. The zoo of exoplanets is vast, ranging from compact star systems and hot Jupiters to super-Earths, mini-Neptunes, and rogue planets. We don’t know the limits for life, and learning about the processes involved in its formation can be truly fascinating.

### TOOLS

-Artificial Intelligence, This project incorporates a rich array of AI-generated images, videos, and animations to enhance the presented material, including Copilot, Midjourney, SkyBox AI, Pika, and ImagineArt
-Blender and Sketchfab, for 3D models of planetary surfaces
-Web developer tools, Wordpress, code in Html, Css and Json 

## Use of Artificial Intelligence

Generative AI for images and videos was crucial for providing media resources in this project, especially when our expertise in arts and graphic design is limited. It allows us to bring our visions to life by generating high-quality visuals that accurately represent our ideas. This technology bridges the gap between imagination and reality. Copilot for photorealistic images of ecosystems, Midjourney used on most planetary views from space, SkyBox AI for 3D and 360 views, Pika used to create animated videos and ImagineArt for videos
